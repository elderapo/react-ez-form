1. Connected input resetter.
For example in auth forms it's nice to be able to reset `login` and `password` input errors after changing one of the input values.
2. Provider for global `translateError` function.
3. Persist input state to eternal source (ex. mobx store).
4. Get input/submit state from ref to be able to change css up the dom (ex. input borders)
